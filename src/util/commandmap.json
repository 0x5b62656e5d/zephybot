Grab the ***official*** crate uninstaller from the [crate install page](<https://www.asus.com/supportonly/armoury%20crate/helpdesk_download/>) and run it. Make sure to reboot afterwards.\n        II. Uninstall MyAsus from control panel or the start menu.\n        III. Get G-Helper from <https://github.com/seerge/g-helper>.\n            a. If Windows asks to install the .NET dependency, proceed installing it.\n            b. If a popup saying something along the lines of \"Unrecognized app,\" click `More info` then `Run anyway`. This is because GHelper does not have a signed certificate. (Refer to `/ghelper-certificate`)\n        IV. Enable `Run on Startup`\n        V. Go to the `Extras` menu in G-Helper and stop Asus services.\n2. Power modes\n    a) When on battery, use `Eco` GPU mode and `Silent` CPU mode\n    b) When plugged in, use `Optimized` GPU mode and `Balanced` CPU mode\n3. Power (Refer to `/battery`)\n    a) Try to use the barrel charger at all times. The USBC charger doesn't have bypass and can wear out the battery faster. (Refer to `Battery`)\n    b) If you're going to be always plugged in, set battery charge to 60%. If you're going to be moving around for school or work, set it to 80-85% (Battery chemistry: Li-ion batteries last longer when kept between 20-80%)",

This isn't G-Helper's fault, the sensor readings itself just aren't accurate.\n\nNote: Stay on barrel charger if you can. The Type-C PD does not have bypass. This means that all the power will have to go thru the battery before being delivered to the board, which can wear the battery out faster. The barrel charger doesn't need to go thru the battery, as it has bypass and goes directly to the board. ***However***, if you own a ROG Zephyrus 2024 model or newer, the Type-C PD will ***have*** bypass.

This is because when an SSD is nearly full, the controller has less free space available for read/write operations, leading to slower performance.",

AMD/Intel and Nvidia have implemented safety mechanisms: the hardware will automatically throttle if it reaches dangerous temps.\n\nQ: *Is there anything I can do to improve the temps?*\nA: You can elevate the laptop for better airflow, or get a cooling pad. Usually, you shouldn't really have to repaste unless the laptop's pretty old or if there's a problem with stock LM/paste.\n\nQ: *Can I use my laptop closed?*\nA: It's not recommended to use the laptop closed. The laptop also dissipates heat from the keyboard, and closing it while using the laptop may trap the heat inside, causing damage to certain components.\n\nQ: *Can I use my laptop on my bed or cloth surfaces?*\nA: No, don't use your laptop on your bed. The cloth/soft surface may clog up the vents and \"choke\" the laptop. Use it on hard surfaces like wood or plastic.",
